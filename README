journalx is a Web Service used to share Journal Entries from
Sugar.

It has a very simple REST API (with JSON) designed by @tch:

Manipulate journal entries
1. POST /entries (new entry)
2. POST /entries/:entry_id (update an existing entry)
3. GET /entries/:entry_id (fetch an existing entry)
4. DEL /entries/:entry_id (delete an existing entry)

Manipulate comments associate with a journal entry
1. POST /entries/:entry_id/comments (new comment for that entry)
2. GET /entries/:entry_id/comments (comments for that entry)
3. DEL /entries/:entry_id/comments/:comment_id (delete an existing comment)

Manipulate your friends lists
1. GET /friends  (your friends list)
2. GET /friends/:friend_id  (a friend's details)
3. GET /friends/:friend_id/entries (friend entries)

== Running the service ==

What you'll need (in Fedora):

* python-django (tested with version 1.4)
* python-imaging (for uploaded screenshots)
* MySQL-python

Steps:

1) create the journalx db (i.e.: create database journalx)
2) update the DB config in journalx/settings.py
3) run:

   ./manage.py syncdb

4) see if tests pass:

   ./manage.py test entries_svc

5) run the server:

   ./manage.py runserver

6) request entries:

   curl http://localhost:8000/entries

You can use the admin module to add/delete entries:

1) create an admin via:

   ./manage.py createsuperuser --username=foo

2) log into http://localhost:8000/admin

To try creating an entry by hand:

 curl \
   -F  screenshot=@/tmp/tincho.jpg \
   -F title='my entry' \
   -F desc='something' \
     http://localhost:8000/entries/
